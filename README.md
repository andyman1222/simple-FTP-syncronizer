<h1>How do I use this?</h1>
Go into the file and edit the top variables. Then, run the file whenever you need an automated FTP transfer. If you want, you can put it into your startup folder so it auto opens.

<h1>What does it do?</h1>
This will automatically upload a file if a file is added, or delete a file if it is removed, to the FTP site. It does not rename or modify, but with modifications it can.

This is entirely client-side; it won't download files from the FTP server to your computer.
